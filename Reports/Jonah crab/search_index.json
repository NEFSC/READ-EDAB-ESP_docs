All continuous temporal data were plotted against time. If there were 30 or more years of data, a geom_gls regression line was fit (yellow = significant increase; purple = significant decrease; no line = no significant trend). If there were fewer than 30 years of data, no regression was fit. 1.2.1 assessmentdata methods Stock assessment and data quality information were compiled into a summary table. B/Bmsy was classified as “DANGER” if it was below 1 and “GOOD” if it was above 1. F/Fmsy was classified as “DANGER” if it was above 1 and “GOOD” if it was below 1. 1.2.2 survdat methods survdat data with zero abundance were not included in this analysis. Abundance and biomass were summed for each year and season. All other metrics were averaged for each year and season. The tables show summary statistics for the entire time series and for the most recent 5 years in the time series.

The stock with the highest ranking is the stock determined to be at the highest risk. In this case, high risk has two meanings: (1) high importance (e.g., a stock with a high catch would have a high risk ranking for the catch indicator) or high vulnerability (e.g., a stock with low B/Bmsy would have a high risk ranking for the B/Bmsy indicator). The normalized rank was determined by dividing each stock’s rank by the total number of stocks considered for that indicator. Stocks that were missing indicator measurements were assigned a normalized rank of 0.5. 1.3.1.2 Individual indicators Risk was calculated over time for all indicators that were documented for five or more species in a given year. Risk was calculated as the average of the past 5 years, as a percent of the historical average. The normalized risk value was calculated as the normalized rank of this species compared to all other species in that year. 1.3.2 Risk within stocks The normalized risk value was calculated as the normalized rank of each yearly measurement compared to all other years.

If residuals are unballenced or the average of the residiuals devates from zero, this could indicate that this grouping differs from the expected growth from the global model. This deviation from the global model may indicate slower or faster growth than predicted, and this may be due to either changing energetic conditions, sexual dimorphism, or other variation in the population. ## [1] &quot;No data&quot; "],["length-at-first-maturity.html", "3.3 Length at first maturity", " 3.3 Length at first maturity 3.3.1 Size at first maturity L50 or length at which 50% maturity can be calculated using differing methods. Using Data sourced from survdat that consist of visual sexual maturity determination and length measurements. Here, L50 is estimated by fitting a logistic generalized linear model to gonadal maturity and body length measurements and estimating the inflection point of the logistic model. This point represents the size where the individual has 50% odds of being mature. Decade variations of this parameter are investigated utilizing decade as a additive and interaction term in the model specification. The relationship between sexual maturity by body size is a well established life history parameter. L50 is a useful metric in fisheries to identify sizes that are able to reproduce. This information can be used to inform regulation as to minimum catch size that should allow for a significant portion of the population to spawn and contribute genetic information to sustain the stock. Changes in this parameter can signal population/evolutionary pressures on the stock with reduction in this size potentially indicating excessive fishing pressure. ## [1] &quot;Not enough data to fit model&quot; 3.3.2 Maturity classification The gonadal development stage can vary between immature and mature. Once mature, there are several stages that represent phases in the spawning sequence. These stages and phases can vary across body length and the proportion of the population in each of these categories can help identify spawning size and what seasonal effects there are on development.
